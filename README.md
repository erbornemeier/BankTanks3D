Final Project

Description:
	This program's purpose was to make a simple tank game with translation, shader programming, and basic game development practices. 

Usage:

	WSAD Keys- Will control the forward movement and the rotation of the player tank

	Escape Key / Q- Closes the program

	Space Key - Shoot a bullet(or another tank) at the other tanks. 

How to compile and run:
	The code can be run by executing 'make' in the directory of the Makefile. If necessary, change the BUILDING_IN_LAB variable to 1 if on a lab machine. Run the program executable that was created ("bank_tanks.exe") . The window should display with the model in the skybox. Close the window or press ESC or Q to stop the program. 

	Note that the model loader had to be changed to add the inline and remove static keywords to include in multiple files. 

Bugs/implementation/etc:
	We were unable to complete this game due to lack of time.
